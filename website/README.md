## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager of your choice)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OchiengPaul442/sf_project.git
   cd sf_project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server with live reload:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.

### Build and Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Once built, you can start the production server with:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

## Deployment

Depending on your hosting platform, the process can vary:

- **Vercel**: Push your repo to GitHub, then import the project on Vercel. It automatically detects Next.js.
- **Netlify**: Use a Next.js-compatible build plugin or run the build and deploy the `.next` folder.
- **Docker**: Create a Dockerfile that runs `npm run build` and `npm run start`.

Check your hosting provider’s documentation for details.

## Environment Variables

If your application uses environment variables, place them in a `.env` or `.env.local` file (never commit these to source control!). For example:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
ANOTHER_SECRET_KEY=super-secret-value
```

> **Note**: Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the client side. Sensitive keys should never be exposed this way.
